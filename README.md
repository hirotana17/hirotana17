### Hi, I'm Hirofumi Tanahashi ðŸ‘‹
I am pursuing my Master's in Computer Science, majoring in Software Engineering and Machine Learning, at the University of Wollongong, Australia. Previously, I worked as a product manager in Japan, where I collaborated with software engineers and designers, primarily focusing on SaaS product development for enterprises. Through this experience, I developed a strong interest in software engineering. I am eager to leverage the analytical and problem-solving skills I honed as a product manager to pursue a career as a Software Engineer.
